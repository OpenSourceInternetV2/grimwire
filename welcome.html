	<h2>Grimwire P2P Web Relay</h2>
	<p>
		Welcome to a new kind of social network: <strong>fully private</strong>, <strong>peer-to-peer</strong>, and <strong>user-hosted</strong>.
		<hr/>
		Grimwire uses WebRTC to connect applications directly to each other. Then, the apps host
		Web services to each other from the browser, meaning your data stays on your computer
		and your friends'.
		<hr/>
		Relays like this help you locate other users and establish the connections. They keep track
		of who's online and what they're running. Any members of this relay can access that
		information once they've logged in.
		<hr/>
		<strong>If you want to run your own private relay, go to
		<a href="http://grimwire.com">grimwire.com</a> and download the software to get started.</strong>
